Abstract 
Due to the lack of transparency, supply chain management regularly had problems with service 
redundancy, ineffective departmental collaboration, and lack of standardisation. Nowadays, it's 
incredibly usual for products to be counterfeited, and it's very impossible to tell if a product is fake 
just by looking at it. For legal businesses, counterfeiters pose serious obstacles, but there are far too 
many of them. People are unaware of the full extent of counterfeit products' impact on brands. 
Various strategies have been developed in the past to circumvent the issue of product counterfeiting. 
The most common techniques are utilising technologies like RFID tags, AI, QR code-based systems, 
etc. However, each of them had a few drawbacks, such as the QR code, which may be copied from a 
real goods and used on a false product, artificial intelligence, which makes use of CNN and machine 
learning and requires a lot of computer power, and more. By following a product's supply chain 
history, this research aims to increase the detection of phoney goods. With the help of blockchain 
technology, which guarantees the identity and traceability of actual products along the supply chain, 
this is made possible. Everything is decentralised in a blockchain-based system so that multiple 
parties can access it simultaneously. One of its key benefits is that the data captured can only be 
changed with the approval of all parties involved, making the information incredibly secure and safe 
from all.

Problem

Product forging happens when an item is sold pre-having a tendency to be another item. It is 
purchaser extortion also, normally characterized as misleading strategic policies that make 
purchasers suffer financial or different misfortunes. Fake products are expanding by 20% in the 
middle between. Fake products include fake shoes, apparel, beauty care products, and hardware. It 
has negative effects on the economy, however, on citizens as well. For instance, unfortunate beauty 
care products can affect skin and cause skin sicknesses and rashes, and fake electronic parts can 
cause a breakdown in devices and can prompt troublesome circumstances and incidents. Low-quality 
garments, and shoes when worn, can cause uneasiness. Subsequently, this issue requires discovering 
some answers for the offer of fake items. One more outcome of forging is that an organization's 
reputation suffers. Since numerous clients are clueless that the item, they are holding is knock off 
they will blame the real organization if the knock off item fails to perform appropriately, breaks into 
pieces quickly, or fails to fulfil their assumptions. Client request reward, either as a discount or 
another item, and they search it out straightforwardly from the authentic organization. A great deal 
of affected organizations might wind up in a situation where they are managing a troubled client who 
is griping about the terrible nature of the thing, and the client care delegate is ignorant that the thing 
in question is a fake. Organizations are gotten between a predicament, endeavouring to abstain from 
with nothing to do and exertion managing unfortunate impersonations of their products while yet 
attempting to keep their clients satisfied. The mischief caused by forgers reaches out past client 
connections. On account of the ways of behaving of forgers, merchants, retailers, and other 
colleagues much of the time lose confidence in real ventures

Solution 

The best moderation measures for beating deceiving fake products in worldwide stockpile chains 
incorporate organization transparency, cost control, and pre-supply assessment approaches, and 
provider relationships with the executives. Thus the target of this project is to introduce the system is 
designed for anti-counterfeit using Blockchain technology and to empower end clients and providers 
to track store network of items in a secured environment. In an outline of the proposed system, it is 
meant to tackle the issue of brand forging and give the opportunity to the client, sellers, and 
providers to take a look at the uprightness of the item

Literature survey 

The survey concentrated on comprehending the origins of counterfeit goods and their societal 
repercussions. Several approaches for detecting fake products exist, including those utilizing Artificial 
Intelligence, QR codes, Machine Learning, and Blockchain. Shaik's methods involved embedding 
public and private keys as QR codes on products. Scanning these QR codes required cryptographic 
functionality within the scanning app for decryption. The manufacturer's server matched buyer 
names and item codes. The scanning app also decrypted the item code ciphertext encoded in the QR 
code [9].Benatia and Baudry et al. introduced a traceability-CPS architecture for supply chain 
management. This architecture comprised multiple interacting layers that facilitated product 
traceability. It also enabled supply chain monitoring and data analysis to enhance product safety and 
quality. Their algorithm involved computing frequent item sets in the product transaction database, 
which could detect abnormal product behaviour [10]. Khalil and Doss et al. proposed a solution using 
RFID-based systems to combat counterfeiting. This system allowed consumers to verify item 
legitimacy by querying the attached RFID tag in stores. Their lightweight scheme was suitable for 
retail environments and utilized low-cost passive RFID tags [11]. Habib and Sardar et al. discussed 
supply chain management (SCM) trends. They identified executives' challenges and transaction 
issues in SCM and proposed blockchain as a solution. They suggested structuring new models around 
transaction processes at a plan level [12]. Daoud and Vu et al. focused on an AI Application 
architecture with three main components: the dataset, detection models, and trained models. Their 
machine learning-based solution detected counterfeit products through training and logo detection 
steps using Faster R-CNN [13]. Chen and Shi et al. introduced a framework for blockchain-based
Supply Chain Quality Intelligence (SCQI). This framework used RFID technology to record quality and 
transaction information, while smart contracts executed quality control to enhance supply chain 
efficiency [14]. Toyoda, Kentaroh, and Mathiopoulos, P Takis et al. proposed a QR code-based system 
for detecting fake products. End users could scan QR codes for product details and transaction 
history [15]. Blockchain-based systems stored data on each node, with nodes exchanging 
information. Each node verified transactions, included them in new blocks, and aimed to secure 
block rights. Ethereum served as the backend operating system, storing product sales data accessible 
to all [7]. A blockchain technology proposal suggested owner-controlled information sharing, 
minimizing third-party interference. Blockchain blocks contained sender-receiver details, transaction 
and product IDs, and metadata [16]
